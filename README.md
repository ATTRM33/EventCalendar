## Overview
- A Simple Java program that allows the user to input meetings or deadlines to the program and display them in a GUI

## How to Run
- For the command line function just run `EventTester.java` for the GUI run `EventPlaner.java` (I know its misspelled).
- When entereing a new meeting the start time, end time, and date must be entered as the format displayed (until I get better at this).
- ONLY MEETING needs a location parameter.
